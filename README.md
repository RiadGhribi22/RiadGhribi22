# Hi, I'm Riad 👋

I was a student at Djilali Liabes University 🎓, where I pursued my studies in **Information Systems Engineering**.  
Since 2021, I specialized in **web development** 🌐, starting with frontend technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** ✨.

As my passion for web development grew ❤️, I transitioned into **full-stack development**, focusing on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) 🚀.  
This allowed me to build **dynamic and scalable** web applications, enhancing both my **frontend** and **backend** skills.

In addition to web development, I have a solid foundation in **Python** 🐍, **Java** ☕, and **C** 💻, which I use for **problem-solving** 🧠.  
My academic background also strengthened my knowledge of **algorithms** and **data structures** 📚, essential for writing **efficient and optimized** code.

Moreover, I have experience working with **databases**, including both **SQL** (MySQL) 🗄️ and **NoSQL** (MongoDB) 🛢️, enabling me to design and manage **structured and unstructured data** efficiently.
